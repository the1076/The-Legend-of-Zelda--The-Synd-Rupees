# The-Legend-of-Zelda--The-Synd-Rupees
An entry for The Female Link Game Jam

### Overview
**The Legend of Zelda: The Synd Rupees** is a 2D platformer being built as an entry in the [Female Link Game Jam](http://jams.gamejolt.io/femalelinkjam).
It is a dungeon crawler that's based upon procedurally generated levels. The gameplay in each playthrough will be different, but the game itself will have an unchanging core narrative that has become a staple of the Legend of Zelda franchise. 

I will add more information about the game here as it becomes available in the build but, for now, I won't make any promises that I'll have to later redact. 

### Play the Development Version
Obviously you can download the project and run it yourself, if you are familiar with Construct 2, but if you would just like to play the current development version, you can play it in your browser here:

I make no promises that you won't get stuck or that the game will actually...work. But, it's a dev build. I'll update this readme with a more production-ready version as soon as there is one available.

### Team
The team behind **The Legend of Zelda: The Synd Rupees** is currently a very small one (as in **just** one). It is currently being developed by [@1076](https://twitter.com/1076), but has had some valuable input from very close friends. 

If you are interested in helping out with music, art, or Construct 2 development, please feel free to reach out to me!

### Acknowledgement
This game is young, but it is already borrowing heavily from very talented and very *generous* people around the web.
